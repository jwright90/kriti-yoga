# Kriti Yoga
Website I made to practice my frontend development skills.

Author: Jason Wright  
Project Start: 11/08/2021  
Project End: TBD  

## Notes @ 28.08.2021
* Finished pricing cards, form submissions (via formspree), accordion FAQs
* Decided to leave footer as is with attributions

### Website Complete!
This is a basic website that has enough functionality for a yoga teacher stating out. I will use this as a base point to add a blog, authentication, class booking and online payment system.

### Next Up
* Accordion: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_accordion.asp
* Complete footer
* Have contact form send email on submit

## Notes @ 27.08.2021
### To dos
* Add accordion FAQs
* Add pricing cards
* Complete footer (three columns)

## Notes @ 25.08.2021
* Additional features to add: smooth scroll, navbar sticky & link background changes as user scrolls down, back to top arrow as user scrolls down, loading page (pre-load images, some of the text / images animate in as user scrolls down.
* Down the line, advanced features I want to work on are: authentication, a booking system and CMS system. 
* I could take this in a million directions, but next goal will be to create a similar website with improved hero page, about section and add a blog feature.

## Notes @ 24.08.2021
### Lessons for next website
* Design the home page to take up the whole space (larger on desktops). I was trying to do 'mobile first' design, but it backfired.
* Try to organise your code better, break everything down into individual components.
* Balance using too many classes with not using enough.
* You need to work on your Javascript!

## Notes @ 12.08.2021
* Add location and phone (click to call) on home page for mobile?

## Notes @ 11.08.2021
* May look into hiring a designer to get some help with mandala illustrations
* I'm looking forward to creating the table for the classes section & form for contact section
* Make font-size respsonsive (based on screen width)?
