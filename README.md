Website I made to practice my frontend development skills.

Author: Jason Wright  
Project Start: 11/08/2021  
Project End: TBD  

## Notes @ 25.08.2021
* Almost complete
* Final touch will be to add smooth scroll
* I could take this in a million directions, but next goal will be to create a similar website with improved hero page, about section and add a blog feature.
* I'm happy with the contact section, timetable and mobile overlay menu.
* Down the line, advanced features I want to work on are: authentication, a booking system and CMS system.

## Notes @ 24.08.2021
### Lessons for next website
* Design the home page to take up the whole space (larger on desktops). I was trying to do 'mobile first' design, but it backfired.
* Try to organise your code better, break everything down into individual components.
* Balance using too many classes with not using enough.
* You need to work on your Javascript!

## Notes @ 12.08.2021
* Add location and phone (click to call) on home page for mobile?

## Notes @ 11.08.2021
* May look into hiring a designer to get some help with mandala illustrations
* I'm looking forward to creating the table for the classes section & form for contact section
* Make font-size respsonsive (based on screen width)?
